This project compiles multiple (AI-related) papers with illustrations, annotations, and brief explanations for technical keywords, terms and previous studies which makes them easier to read and to get the main idea intuitively.

- [object detection papers with annotations](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/papers-with-annotations/tree/master/object-detection)
- [ai and cognitive science related papers with annotations](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/papers-with-annotations/tree/master/ai-and-cognitive-science)
- [unsupervised and semi/self-supervised learning related papers with annotations](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/papers-with-annotations/blob/master/unsupervised-and-semi-supervised-learning)
- [convolutional neural networks related papers with annotations](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/papers-with-annotations/blob/master/convolutional-neural-networks/README.md)

Please feel free to open new PR (pull request) if you have such kind of annotated research papers (related to AI, ML, DL, neuroscience, cognitive sciences). 


Also, please give us a feedback by opening an issue on this repository. We are looking forward for your collaboration!

## How are the annotations generated:
**Software:** Notability App â€”Â import pdf to the App, make annotations (handwriten notes, import the figures, stickers, etc)
**Hardware:** iPad (6th generation) with Apple Pencil (1st generation). However any iPad which supports Apple pencil (or any Android tablets) should be fine.
